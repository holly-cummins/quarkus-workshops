= Welcome
Let's start from the beginning.
Quarkus.
What's Quarkus?
That's a pretty good question and probably a good start.
If you go to the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus web site], you'll read that Quarkus is "_A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot & GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_."
This description is somewhat unclear but does an outstanding job at using bankable keywords.
It's also written: "_Supersonic Subatomic Java_."
This is a way of saying that Quarkus is really fast, and itâ€™s really light.
But what does Quarkus _do_?

In practice, Quarkus is a stack to develop distributed systems and modern applications in Java, Kotlin, or Scala.
Quarkus applications are tailored for the Cloud, containers, and Kubernetes.
That does not mean you can't use Quarkus in other environments, there are no limits, but the principles infused in Quarkus have made containerization of applications more efficient.
In this workshop, we will explain what Quarkus is and because the best way to understand Quarkus is to use it, build a set of microservices with it.
Again, Quarkus is not limited to microservices, but it's a generally well-understood type of architecture.

This workshop offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Quarkus, from the first line of code to making services, to consuming them, and finally to assembling everything in a consistent system.
But, what are we going to build?
Well, it's going to be a set of microservices:

* Using Quarkus
* Using HTTP and events (with Apache Kafka)
* With some parts of the dark side of microservices (resilience, health, monitoring with Prometheus)
* Answer the ultimate question: are super-heroes stronger than super-villains?

This workshop is a BYOL (_Bring Your Own Laptop_) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop.
You need JDK {jdk-version} on your machine, Apache Maven ({maven-version}), and Docker.
On Mac and Windows, Docker for _x_ is recommended instead of the Docker toolbox setup.

What you are going to learn:

* What is Quarkus, and how you can use it
* How to build an HTTP endpoint (REST API) with Quarkus
* How to access a relational database
* How you can use Swagger and OpenAPI
* How you test your microservice
* How to build a reactive microservice, including reactive data access
* How you improve the resilience of your service
* How to build event-driven microservices with Kafka
* How to build native executable
* How to extend Quarkus with extensions
* And much more!

Ready? Here we go!
