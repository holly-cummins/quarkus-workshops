= Preparing for the Workshop

This workshop needs internet access to download all sorts of Maven artifacts, Docker images, and even pictures.
Some of these artifacts are large, and because we have to share internet connexions at the workshop, it is better to download them before the workshop.
Here are a few commands that you can execute before the workshop.

== Download the workshop scaffolding

icon:hand-point-right[role="red",size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

First, download the zip file  {github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop.zip, and unzip it wherever you want.
This zip file contains _some_ of the code of the workshop, and you will need to complete it.

In this workshop, you will be developing an application dealing with Super Heroes (and Super-Villains ðŸ¦¹) as well as Quarkus extensions.
The code will be separated into two different directories:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ super-heroes         | The entire Super Hero application
}
}
@endsalt
----

=== Super Heroes Application

Under the `super-heroes` directory you will find the entire Super Hero application spread throughout a set of subdirectories, each one containing a microservice or some tooling.
The final structure will be the following:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ super-heroes
++ event-statistics        | UI and application dealing with fight statistics (you will create it)
++ infrastructure          | All the needed infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka...)
++ kubernetes              | All the files required to deploy on Kubernetes
++ load-super-heroes       | Stress tool loading heroes, villains and fights
++ rest-fight              | REST API allowing super heroes to fight (you will create it)
++ rest-hero               | Reactive REST API for CRUD operations on Heroes (you will create it)
++ rest-villains            | REST API for CRUD operations on Villains (you will create it)
++ ui-super-heroes         | Angular application so we can fight visually
}
}
@endsalt
----

Most of these subdirectories are Maven projects and follow the Maven directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+  super-heroes
++ rest-villains
+++ src
++++  main
+++++  docker
+++++  java
+++++  resources
++++  test
+++++  java
}
}
@endsalt

== Warming up Maven

Now that you have the initial structure in place, navigate to the root directory and run:

icon:hand-point-right[role="red",size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

By running this command, it downloads all the required dependencies.

== The completed workshop

You can find the completed code on {github-url}.
So, if you are stuck, feel free to check the solution.

To build the completed workshop, you need to run the following commands from the root project:

[source,shell]
----
> mvn clean install -f super-heroes/extension-version
> mvn clean install -Pcomplete
----

== Ready?

After the prerequisites have been installed and the different components have been warmed up, it's now time to write some code!
